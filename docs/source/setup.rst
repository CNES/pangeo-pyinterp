Installing the library
======================

This chapter presents the steps to build the library, run the tests, generate
the test coverage report and finally produce this automatic documentation.

Building the library is not an easy thing, that's why this project is available
in the `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org>`_ distribution for convenient
installations. You can also install it with pip, after carefully installing all
the dependencies needed to build the library.
