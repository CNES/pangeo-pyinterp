# Bicubic

- [x] Avoid memory allocation for each 1D interpolation. Perhaps it is
      necessary to allocate the memory in the structure manipulating the
      calculation frame.

# 3D interpolation

- [ ] Cubic
- [ ] Added an option to interpolate Z linearly or by the selected
      method for the 2D field.
