Setup with Anaconda
===================

`Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/>`_  is a free and open-source distribution of
the Python programming language for scientific computing, that aims to simplify
package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package
management system `conda`.

The first step is to install the anaconda distribution. The installation manual
for this software is detailed `here <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_.

To install the software using `conda` simply execute the following command: ::

    conda install pyinterp -c conda-forge

This command will install the software and the necessary dependencies. More
information is available on the syntax of this command on the `related
documentation <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html>`_.
