"""Unstructured Grid Interpolation
===============================

This example illustrates the various interpolation methods available for
unstructured grids, such as data from satellite tracks or other non-uniform
sources.

The core of unstructured grid interpolation in ``pyinterp`` is the
:py:class:`pyinterp.RTree` class, which uses an R-tree data structure for
efficient spatial queries.

First, we'll create a synthetic dataset to represent our unstructured grid.

# The R-tree can be configured to work with different geodetic systems. The
# default is WGS-84. Here, we'll use the default.

        0.5 * numpy.sin(numpy.radians(lon) * 5) *
        numpy.sin(numpy.radians(lat) * 4))

# Now, we generate random longitude and latitude points and populate our R-tree

# Interpolation Methods
# ---------------------
#
# ``pyinterp`` offers several methods for interpolating data from an
# unstructured grid. We will now apply and visualize each of them.
#
# Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Kriging are
# all interpolation methods used to estimate a value for a target location based
# on the values of surrounding sample points. However, each method approaches
# this estimation differently.
#
# IDW uses a weighted average of the surrounding sample points, where the weight
# assigned to each point is inversely proportional to its distance from the
# target location. The further away a sample point is from the target location,
# the less influence it has on the estimated value. This method is relatively
# simple to implement and computationally efficient, but it can produce
# over-smoothed results in areas with a lot of sample points and under-smoothed
# results in areas with few sample points.
#
# The Window Function method, much like IDW, uses a weighted average of the
# surrounding sample points. However, instead of the weight being solely
# determined by the inverse distance, it is determined by a kernel function (the
# "window"). This function gives the most weight to points at the center of the
# window and progressively less weight to points further away. This can
# sometimes provide a smoother result than IDW.
#
# RBF, on the other hand, models the spatial relationship between sample points
# and the target location by using a mathematical function (radial basis
# function) that is based on the distance between the points. The radial basis
# function is usually Gaussian, multiquadric, or inverse multiquadric. The
# estimated value at the target location is obtained by summing up the weighted
# contributions of all sample points. This method is more flexible than IDW as
# it can produce both smooth and non-smooth surfaces depending on the chosen
# radial basis function. However, it can be computationally expensive and may
# produce artifacts in areas with sparse or clustered sample points.
#
# Kriging is a geostatistical interpolation method that uses a variogram to
# model the spatial correlation between sample points. The variogram describes
# how the similarity between sample points decreases as the distance between
# them increases. The estimated value at the target location is obtained by a
# weighted average of the surrounding sample points, where the weights are
# determined by the variogram model. This method is considered to be the most
# accurate interpolation method as it provides an optimal and unbiased estimate
# of the value at the target location. However, it is also the most
# computationally expensive and requires a good understanding of the underlying
# spatial structure of the data.
#
# In summary, the choice of interpolation method is a trade-off between
# simplicity, computational cost, and the quality of the results.
#
# * **IDW** is a good starting point as it is simple and fast.
# * The **Window Function** can provide a smoother alternative to IDW.
# * **RBF** offers more flexibility but at a higher computational cost and with
#   a risk of artifacts.
# * **Kriging** is the most accurate method but also the most complex and
#   computationally intensive, requiring a good understanding of the data's
#   spatial structure.
#
# In this notebook, we will compare the results of these four interpolation
# methods on a synthetic dataset.
